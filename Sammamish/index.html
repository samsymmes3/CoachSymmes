        &emsp; Kingco Tracker displays relavant information on the current standings
        for qualifying for the Kingco league meet (May 12 & 13), broken down by athlete and
        by event, as well as the outlook on the team competition at Kingco.
        There are 16 spots in each event for athletes at the Kingco League meet.
        These spots will be given to the 16 athletes with the best marks this
        season with a couple exceptions. For vertical jumps, you must be able
        to hit the official opening height in addition to being top 16. If you
        are not quite top 16, you may still get a spot if another athlete
        scratches an event. Scatches are very common (a few may drop) in the 400m, and 800m because
        they are hard to double with other events, and jumping events because
        the sprinters, who are often also the jumpers, fill up their four event
        limit fairly quickly.

      <p style="margin-bottom:4px;">
        &#x2022; Qualifying: As of right now, who's in Kingco (if you're close to number
        16, people are going to be gunning for your spot), who's close, and what the
        number 16 mark is  ("Cutoff")
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:4px;">
        &#x2022; Rankings: As of right now, what events is each person ranked in the
        top 24 in Kingco

        &emsp; Districts Tracker displays information for the Bi-District meet
        against District 3 (May 19 & 20). Kingco shares berths to State with
        the leagues that make up District 3. Combined, the two districts get to
        send six athletes to State in each event. Those six will be the top six
        finishers at the Bi-District meet.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:4px;">
        &#x2022; Qualifying: To Qualify for Districts, you have to finish in the top five
        at Kingco. So the "Cutoff" listed is the current #5 mark in Kingco. The
        actual mark needed to qualify might be faster, might be slower. The spots
        go to whoever performs the best on the day!
