        &emsp; Kingco Tracker displays relavant information on the current standings
        for qualifying for the Kingco league meet (May 12 & 13), broken down by athlete and
        by event, as well as the outlook on the team competition at Kingco.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0px">
        &emsp; There are 16 spots in each event for athletes at the Kingco League meet.
        These spots will be given to the 16 athletes with the best marks this
        season with a couple exceptions. For vertical jumps, you must be able
        to hit the official opening height in addition to being top 16. If you
        are not quite top 16, you may still get a spot if another athlete
        scratches an event. Scatches are very common (a few may drop) in the 400m, and 800m because
        they are hard to double with other events, and jumping events because
        the sprinters, who are often also the jumpers, fill up their four event
        limit fairly quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        By Event: As of right now, who's in Kingco (if you're close to number
        16, people are going to be gunning for your spot), who's close, and what the
        number 16 mark is.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Individual: As of right now, what events is each person in, or close
        to in Kingco.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Team: How does our team stack up? Scores on the left, what events
        each team is scoring in on the right.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:48px">
        &emsp; State Tracker displays the current outlook for qualifying for the State
        meet (May 25-27), as well as the team's outlook at State.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0px">
        &emsp; Unlike Kingco, you do not qualify for the State meet with
        times/marks posted during the season. This means the times listed as
        a "cutoff" are estimates based on marks people have posted so far
        this year. To qualify to for State, you must qualify through rounds in
        the post season. If you finish top five at Kingco, you qualify for the
        Bi-District meet the following week against District 3. If you finish top
        six at the Bi-District meet, you earn a spot at State. This format means
        that athletes have to be able to perform in a single race, so it's a
        great opportunity to earn a spot even if other people have posted
        better marks than you this season. Last year, our athletes performed very
        well at Districts, and we got to take a lot of kids to State, so
        hopefully this year will be the same!
      </p>
      <p>
        By Event: As of right now, who's marks would get them to State
        (assuming you make Districts), who's close, and what is the sixth best
        mark headed into the Districts meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Individual: Listing each person who looks like they have a shot to
        make a run at state, and what their rank is between districts 2 and 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Team: How does our team stack up against the whole state?
