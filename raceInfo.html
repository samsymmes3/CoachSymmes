        This is our race schedule we have so far for the 2024 Cross Country Season!
        A great thing with cross country is that the whole team gets to go to
        the invitationals, so everyone is expected to run the races on Saturdays.
        Some of the invitationals have upwards of 200 schools, but everyone is
        put in races with athletes of a similar ability level. Invitationals are
        a great opportunity to compete at your level.

      <p>
        Bellarmine is a smaller Invitational, with a course that is only 2 miles.
        This is a great low-key way to start the season, get a first peek at
        what Invitationals are like, and get used to racing again.

        Ft. Steilacoom is a medium-sized Invite. There are currently 76 teams

        courses that change, and aren't just like running a track. There is a
        very fast first mile, followed by two
        big hills, where you will have to practice downshifting up the hill, and
        hitting the gas hard on the way back down.
