        &emsp; Process: Each course was given a distance to make athletes' times on
        the course make the most sense (least squares). When athletes performed
        well on a course, that performance was weighted more heavily, and poor
        performances were given much lower weights. This means that if a few
        athletes didn't show up to perform well on a course, their marks were not
        counted for as much as those who showed up ready to race.

        &emsp; Interesting Takeaways:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:50px;margin-top:0">
        &#x2022; Although this is not broken down by gender,
        girls performed significantly better at big invitationals and championship
        races than boys. This does not mean OUR boys and girls, this analysis
        included all athletes across the nation. The easiest explanation would be
        that those are generally large races, and the girls fields being smaller
        makes it easier to perform well. But, this difference was generally around
        1%, which is very large (~10s over 5k), much larger than I would
        think, so I thought it was very interesting.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;margin-top:0">
          &#x2022; When a course was run
        multiple times, the results were often significantly different. This
        meant you could get an indication of how weather and course conditions affect times.
        Hole In The Wall ran almost 100m shorter during the District meet than
        at the Invitational (could be people being more fit, less people on the
        course, better weather), and State ran progressively slower as the day
        went on (running ~13m (3s) shorter every class), as the course got torn up,
        and the wind picked up.
